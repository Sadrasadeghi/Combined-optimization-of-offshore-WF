# Combined-optimization-of-offshore-WF
This is an algorithm for combined optimization of layout and sector management of offshore WFs

Since in the pywake for the chosen site there were no data regarding the turbulenc intensity of air firstly we need to cnosider the changing of air turbulence
intensity with different wind speed. To do this U uesd NTM modified model. Then the outputof first code (NTM weighted) is used for combined optimization of
wind farm.
